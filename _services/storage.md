If you need more time between pickup and dropoff of your items, we offer a variety of storage solutions in our dedicated secure storage facility.

## Crated storage

To keep smaller loads secure and safe, we can store your items in wooden crates in our secure storage facility. When collecting your items, we pack them securely in the right size crate which we then store in our facility. For delivery, we simply put the crate in our van, drive over, and unpack the crate only at the point of delivery. So your items get packed, stored, and delivered without having to pack and unpack in between. This is easier for us, but also provides additional security for you.

## Containered storage

We store larger loads in shipping containers within our secure storage facility. When we pick up your items, we put them in our van, then offload the can into the container. For delivery, we then load up the van from the container, drive over, and offload the van. This process is a little more involved than crated storage, but rest assure that our team will handle your items with care at all stages of the process.
