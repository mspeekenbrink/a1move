House removals typically need a dedicated van and a two-man team with removal equipment such as trolleys, lifts, blankets, straps. We'll take care of that. Our dedicated house removers will help you move your belongings safely from your old home to our van and then to your new home.

## Standard package

In our standard package, you pack your smaller items securely in moving boxes, and items such as matresses in covers. We'll bring moving blankets to protect larger pieces of furniture (e.g. tables, chairs, couches and wardrobes). We will load all your items securely in our van, ensuring your items are safe during transit, and bring all your items inside your new home.

## Premium package

Our premium package includes an additional packing and unpackin service. If you've moved before, you know that packing well takes time. In our premium package, we take care of this for you, ensuring your items are packed to the highest standard. Before moving, we will pack your belongings securely using our own materials. Upon arrival at your new home, we will unpack your items and remove all packing materials for recycling.
