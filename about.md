Hi, I'm Alex, director of A1Move. I have over 8 years experience in the international transport business. During that time, I have learned that transport is not just about moving things from A to B: It is about taking care. At A1Move, we care for your items, from pickup to delivery, whether a single box or a whole house removal.

I work with a small team of dedicated drivers and movers. That way, I can guarantee the level of service that I aspire to, and that my customers have come to expect. I personally oversee all our work, and will often accompany my team on jobs. By keeping my feet on the ground I know exactly what my customers want, and how we best can deliver that.

## Our fleet

1. Solid-walll Luton vans with lift for house removals.
2. Curtain-sided Luton vans for pallet deliveries.
3. Low-loader vans for very heavy items.


## Our storage facility

Our storage facility is located in Basildon, England. We offer storage in both wooden crates and steel shipping containers. Our storage solution is designed to be a temporary and secure holding place between pickup and deivery. If you need urgent access to your items whilst in storage, this can be arranged for a small fee.
